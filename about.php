                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Founded with a passion for literature and learning, Chandrani Book Shop has been serving book lovers for years. Our journey began with a simple belief: that books have the power to transform lives, expand horizons, and connect people across cultures and generations.</p>
                    
                    <p>Named after our founder's vision of creating a "moonlit sanctuary" for readers (Chandrani meaning "moonlight" in Sanskrit), our bookshop has grown from a small local store to a comprehensive online platform serving readers worldwide.</p>
                    
                    <p>We pride ourselves on our carefully curated collection that spans across genres, from timeless classics that have shaped literature to contemporary bestsellers that capture the spirit of our times. Whether you're seeking adventure in fantasy realms, wisdom in philosophical texts, or escape in romantic tales, we have something special waiting for you.</p>
