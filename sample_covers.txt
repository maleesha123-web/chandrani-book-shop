Sample Book Cover Images

To test the book cover functionality, you can add images to the 'images' folder with these names:

1. the_great_gatsby.jpg - for "The Great Gatsby"
2. to_kill_a_mockingbird.jpg - for "To Kill a Mockingbird"  
3. 1984.jpg - for "1984"
4. pride_and_prejudice.jpg - for "Pride and Prejudice"
5. harry_potter.jpg - for "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"

You can download book cover images from:
- Open Library Covers API
- Google Books API
- Or create placeholder images

The system will automatically show a placeholder with the book emoji and title if no cover image is found.

Note: Run update_database.php through your web server to add the cover_image column to existing databases.
